### About

Code with Aloha (Previously known as Code for Hawaii) was a Code for America Brigade, but is now a member of the [Alliance of Civic Technologists](https://www.civictechnologists.org/). We are volunteers interested in open data, open knowledge, civic apps, big data, data visualization, APIs and the application of technology to make our communities better.

We encourage civic engagement and collaboration with our local government. We are engaged citizens with backgrounds and interest in technology, design, business management, policy and good government.

### Active Projects

- [Hawaii Zoning Atlas](https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/Hawaii-Zoning-Atlas) - Interactive map showing how outdated zoning laws make it hard to build diverse, affordable housing in Hawaii
- [HIERR](https://github.com/codewithaloha/hierr) - A demographic survey wrapper around [pol.is](https://pol.is/) aimed to discover ways to make Hawaii's economy more resilient, sustainable, and equitable

### Previous Projects

- [Hawaii Food Oasis](https://hi.foodoasis.net/) - A map to provide information about food pantries and meal programs to food seekers in Hawaii
- [UIPA](https://uipa.org/) - A forum to publicize FOIA record requests and replies so that others do not have to ask for the same information and replies can be scrutinized by the public
