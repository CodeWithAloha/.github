### About

Code with Aloha (Previously known as Code for Hawaii) was a Code for America Brigade, but is now a member of the [Alliance of Civic Technologists](https://www.civictechnologists.org/). We are volunteers interested in open data, open knowledge, civic apps, big data, data visualization, APIs and the application of technology to make our communities better.

We encourage civic engagement and collaboration with our local government. We are engaged citizens with backgrounds and interest in technology, design, business management, policy and good government.
